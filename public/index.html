                <div class="mainText">I'm a web developer based in Ukraine with over two years of programming experience. During this time, I've completed numerous unique and exciting projects that showcase my growing expertise. In addition to my love for coding, I have a strong interest in web design and am eager to continue honing my skills in this area. I enjoy creating dynamic and responsive web solutions, and I invite you to explore my projects to get a better understanding of my work.
                    <br><br>
                    My primary source of programming education is Creator IT Academy, a Ukrainian institution that focuses on programming and robotics. This year, I'm embarking on a new journey as I start high school, and Iâ€™m excited to achieve even more in my favorite field!</div>
